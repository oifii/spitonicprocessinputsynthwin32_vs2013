/*
Because of the fancy TONIC_REGISTER_SYNTH macro, and because this synth has the same interface
as Synth it's not necessary to create a header file. You can create an instance of this synth using 
SynthFactory::createInstance(SYNTH_NAME), where SYNTH_NAME is the name supplied to TONIC_REGISTER_SYNTH.
